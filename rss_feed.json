NCAA settlement, new Tennessee Tech Director of Athletics Casey Fox has announced that the University\u2019s Department of Athletics will opt into the terms of the settlement starting in the 2025-26 academic year.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis week, we made the decision for Tennessee Tech to opt in to the NCAA settlement,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAfter carefully reviewing the final terms, we believe this choice is in the best long-term interest of our athletic department.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe recent finalization of the roster grandfathering provision played a key role in solidifying our decision. By opting in, we position ourselves to better adapt to the evolving collegiate athletics environment, while also creating greater flexibility to leverage opportunities around Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) and potential revenue sharing.\u201d",
